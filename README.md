## Features

- **Multiple Items Display**: The carousel can display several items at once.
- **Navigation Controls**: Includes previous and next buttons to navigate through the items.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Provides a smooth sliding effect between items.

- **Styles**: Update the CSS in `src/styles/Carousel.css` to change the look and feel of the carousel.
